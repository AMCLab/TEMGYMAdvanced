I think we need to check that this code I have written is correct, and that it matches Janghyun's result. There could easily be an incorrect sign somewhere, but it shouldn't be too hard to compare and find out. I will add a plots of the axial potential and axial electric field soon also, to compare with Janghyun. With some more alignment of parameters (starting and end electron plane in z etc.), we should be able to compare the deflection amount between multislice and ray tracing, and from there we can perhaps measure projected potential with ray tracing also. \n","\n","I think it's possible for me to calculate the phase difference of the electron at the \"final plane\" using optical path length integral calculation. I will work on this next. From here it might be possible to measure aberrations if we build up enough data via fitting of the phase image with a suitable basis (No idea if this is possible or if it even makes sense, I've never seen it done before). It should at least be possible to build up enough rays to trace a \"phase image\" (assuming the Optical path lenght calculation works) with a parallelised code.\n","\n","I have looked into some analytical ways to calculate the aberration integrals of this wire setup, but I don't think I can do it easily. I think I know why the Differential algebra method won't work on exotic potentials for me: It is absolutely neccessary to break the potential down into a power series expansion. I think this because every method of deriving aberration integrals, or calculating aberrations that I know of successively adds more terms of a series expansion to obtain higher order aberrations. One can't just trace rays through an arbitrary potential and obtain aberration coefficients using the DA method. One method that can find aberrations in an arbitrary potential is to trace rays, and fit a polynomial to the ray deviation in the image plane. I have not implemented this yet but it could be an option here to try. \n","\n","I do know it is possible to get aberrations analytically for this system, I just don't think anyone has published a method: What it boils down to is firstly understanding the symmetries of the system, so one can write the correct series expansion of the potential along some symmetry plane (See Page 95 of Hawkes principles of electron optics, 7.4 Multipole Fields). From here, one will obtain an expression with a series of axial potential functions, which are non-trivial to obtain. The only paper I know of which shows how to obtain the axial potential functions is here: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-abstract/68/12/4409/347350/Analytical-and-numerical-computation-of-multipole?redirectedFrom=fulltext for a magnetic deflector system. Lencova obtains the axial potential functions of a magnetic deflector system using maple. I think for this wire setup, it has to be possible to do this, and it must have dipole symmetry when the two wires are exactly opposite each other, so that is already a good start. \n","\n","Basically to calculate aberration coefficients for this system I think one needs to; \n","\n","step 1: Write the potential function (which we have already)\n","step 2: Obtain the taylor expansion of this potential using Maple\n","step 3: Seperate in each term the fourier components with respect to the polar angle $\\theta$.\n","step 4: From here it's unclear, but having the series expansion then allows me to try the Differential Algebra method or otherwise. \n","\n","For now though, I think a numerical method such as measuring the phase difference and fitting a polynomial basis is more likely to succeed, if not only for the fact that it is somewhat novel. \n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
